# Python
This is an example of Python code from some SDS348 homework. Python is a general-purpose coding language that can be used for different types of programming and software development besides web development. For more information, visit https://www.python.org/.

```{python}
def howlong(s):
  if len(s) < 5:
      print(s, "is shorter than 5 characters")
  elif len(s) < 10:
      print(s, "is >5 and <=10 characters")
  else: # this else goes with `len(s) < 30`, NOT with `len(s) < 50`
      print(s, "is 10+ characters")
howlong("homework")
```

# Here is an example of reticulate using R and Python

Here is some python code:
```{python}
import seaborn as sns
df = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
```

Here is some R code:
```{R}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)

df <- py$df

ggplot(df)+geom_point(aes(carat,price))
```
