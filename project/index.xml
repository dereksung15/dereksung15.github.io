      <description>1. Introduction The two datasets used for this data analysis consist of data on mass shootings in 2019 and gun ownership in 2019 by state. This data was sourced from Statista and GunViolenceArchive, respectively. This data analysis will test to see if there are any potential associations between these two variables. If more guns are in circulation in a given population, one might expect a higher occurence of mass shootings.</description>
